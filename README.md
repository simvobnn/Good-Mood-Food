# Good-Mood-Food
Project Exam: Build a Foodie Website

You have been tasked with creating a website called Good Food Mood which helps people to find recipes. The site is aimed at working people who are interested in eating healthy and interesting food, but don't have a lot of time to read recipe books. The site should feel fun and engaging for users and guide them to take action.

Using an API, allow users to input ingredients (and perhaps any dietary concerns) and get back a list of recipes. The site should also encourage them to sign up for a weekly newsletter with featured recipes.

Use APIs to create interactive pages. You can find various free and open food-related APIs. Find one that suits you best.
The site should include a minimum of 4 pages, be responsive, and function well on a variety of platforms.
The site should employ Javascript/JSON API for dynamic data and construction and styling of HTML/CSS.
